## Directory Structure
1. `img` - the images directory stores the minor images that allow the GUI to display properly. These images will be displayed at runtime via the GUI.
2. `GUI` - this is the code that defines the user interface and hooks up to the logic and models.
3. `/` - this is the directory where the main logical code goes to setup/seed the database, to connect and interact with the datbase, to parse data from classes.uoregon.edu.
