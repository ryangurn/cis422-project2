## Team Organization

## Design Making Considerations
There is no single decision maker within our group, we all work together to come to a consensus on what to develop based on the plan, requirements, and design specification. All decisions regarding design are intended to be worked on as a group to ensure that the integration is seamless. We will settle any disputes by a simple majority vote, however it is unlikely that this will occur. 

When we are working through making decisions we will attempt to make decisions based on the following criteria:

(Most decisions will start out in the non-technical realm and then end up needing some additional technical considerations to be made. Thus this is meant to be a two part process, starting in the non-technical realm with documentation, discussion, and the specific outlined considerations. Then moving to the technical realm and including the additional considerations.)

Non Technical Decisions:

How many resources (people, staff hours, equipment, etc;) will be consumed by a modification?
* Will the outcome of the decision benefit the end user?
* What are the risks and rewards of implementing the decision?
* Will making this decision impact any of the previous decisions made?
* How does this help reinforce the software requirements specifications?
* What changes will be needed within the software design specification?
* Can this decision be implemented while remaining within the constraints of the project?
* How will this decision affect the requirements of the project?

Technical Decisions:

Can a standalone prototype be developed within the given time?
* Will the standalone prototype produce significant benefits to the user?
* What change to functionality will be mandated by the decision?
* What are the risks and rewards to the user?
* What is the impact to future maintenance or development?
* Does this impact how components are linked together or interact?
* Where in the software will this functionality be added and how will that impact that component and it's linked elements?
